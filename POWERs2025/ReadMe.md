Working Principle repository hosts the representations of working principles based on the Pahlâ€“Beitz account.

This release was introdcued in POWERs 2025 Workshop (https://powers-workshop.github.io). 

In this version, we propose ontology design patterns for representing knowledge about working principles in a BFO-conformant manner, building on the engineering design framework developed by Pahl and Beitz.
